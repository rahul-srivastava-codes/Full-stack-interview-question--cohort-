<h2>Difference between ecmascript and javascript?</h2>
<p>ECMAScript is like a rulebook , it sets the guidelines on how a scripting language should work.

services, and even desktop or mobile apps. It’s fast, efficient, and great for building scalable applications — especially because it 
can handle many requests at once without slowing down.
