<h2>Difference between ecmascript and javascript?</h2>
<p>ECMAScript is like a rulebook , it sets the guidelines on how a scripting language should work.
JavaScript is a language that follows those rules to make websites interactive.
So, ECMAScript is the theory, and JavaScript is how we use that theory in real life.</p>

<h2>What is <b>node.js?</b></h2>
Javascript is a language , node.js is run time . Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside of a web browser.
Usually, JavaScript is used to make websites interactive, but with Node.js, you can use JavaScript to build things like servers, backend 
services, and even desktop or mobile apps. It’s fast, efficient, and great for building scalable applications — especially because it 
can handle many requests at once without slowing down.
<h4>Bun is also a run time as task it to beat nodejs everytime. NOT much asked but can make you look cool in the group of 4 guys.</h4>

<h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
<p><b>Protocol</b> defined for machines to communicate mostly for websites bero. Ex-> Frontend talk to backend</p>

<h3>What is DNS?</h3>
<p>think of DNS (Domain Name System) like the phonebook of the internet.
When you type a website’s name, like www.google.com, your computer doesn’t actually understand names — it understands numbers called 
IP addresses (like 142.250.182.206). DNS takes the website name you type and translates it into the right IP address so your computer 
can find and connect to that website.In short: DNS makes it easy for us to use website names instead of remembering long numbers.</p>
